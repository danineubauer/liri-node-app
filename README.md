# What is this app? :hammer:
- This is a command line node app that takes in parameters in the terminal and returns data. - 
There are four commands that the app takes - 'concert-this', 'spotify-this-song', 'movie-this' & 'do-what-it-says'. Each command followed by the search of the user, pulls up information for the user based on the search. 

# This is what it looks like in the terminal:

<img src='/photos/2.png'>

# Why use it? :gear:
This app replaces long hours of scrolling through libraries of movies, concert dates and songs. Instead, a user can just enter this app and command to pull the information they would like to see.  

# How is the app organized? :balance_scale:	
The app is organized into a few different files: liri.js (main script), env & gitignore (hold info that isn't displayed on github), keys.js, package.json & random.txt (with random text). 

# How do I run this app? :bow_and_arrow:
To run this app, enter the folder of the app in the terminal and type: 'node liri.js' followed by one of the four commands which you'd like to use. Then follow it up by a search of your choice. 
For example: 'node liri.js concert-this madonna'
Press enter and your search will be displayed.
